## 👩🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me
I'm Fardin Abbasi, now a senior student in EE at the University of Tehran (UT). I'm also studying management as a minor program. I've so far had a very pleasing time during my undergraduate studies, and am currently seeking more opportunities to grow and influence my community.
